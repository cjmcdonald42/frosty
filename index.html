    <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
    <h2>By Robert Frost</h2>
    <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.</br>
    <p>His house is in the village though;</br>
    <p>He will not see me stopping here</br>
    <p>To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>

    <p>My little horse must think it queer</br>
    <p>To stop without a farmhouse near</br>
    <p>Between the woods and frozen lake</br>
    <p>The only other sound's the sweep</br>
    <p>Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>

    <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,</br>
    <p>But I have promises to keep,</br>
    <p>And miles to go before I sleep,</br>
    <p>And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
